Q1)Extract a dataset of your choice and compute the correlation between
any two variables and visualize the relationship using scatter plot.

Q2)

variables using Q-Q plot and interpret the results.

Q3) Consider the Price quotes dataset and perform the following:
1. Generate the Summary statistics of the price quotes from Mary and Barry
and interpret the results.
2. The standard deviation of Mary’s price quotes is $11.05. The standard error
of the mean of Mary’s price quotes is $3.19. Both are measures of variability.
a) distinguish between these two numbers on the basis of how they are
calculated and what they mean.
b) Provide an interpretation of each number.

Q4) Consider the Treatment Facility dataset and perform the following:
1. Generate the Summary statistics of the Treatment facility and interpret
the results.

behavioral problems and staff turnover.

Q5)Consider the Baggage complaints dataset and perform the following:
1. Generate the Summary statistics and interpret the results.
2. Compare the baggage complaints for three airlines: American Eagle,
Hawaiian, and United. Which airline has the best record? The worst? Are
complaints getting better or worse over time? Are there other factors, such
as destinations, seasonal effects or the volume of travelers that affect
baggage performance?

Q6)Consider the Medical Malpractice dataset and perform the following.
